# Backend
This Python backend code is a Flask-based academic performance management system that integrates database management, role-based access control, encryption, machine learning, email notifications, audit logging, and PDF report generation. Below is a high-level breakdown of its key functionalities:

1. Web Framework & Security
Uses Flask to create a web server.
Implements session-based authentication (session stores user login info).
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) (@requires_roles) restricts access to certain routes.
2. Database & User Authentication
Connects to a MySQL database (pymysql).
Provides a user login endpoint (/login) that verifies credentials and stores user info in a session.
Logs audit actions to track user activities (log_audit).
3. Performance Management
Allows teachers/admins to insert/update student performance data (/performance, /add_performance).
Implements trend analysis to identify underperforming students (/analyze_trends).
4. Machine Learning Integration
Uses Linear Regression (/predict_risk) to predict student risk levels based on attendance, test scores, and behavior.
Uses a Decision Tree Classifier (/predict_intervention) to recommend interventions (e.g., tutoring).
5. Security (Encryption)
Implements AES encryption (encrypt, decrypt) to secure sensitive data.
6. Notifications & Alerts
Sends email alerts to parents/teachers using Flask-Mail (/send_alerts).
Uses Firebase Admin SDK for potential push notifications.
7. Reporting & Visualization
Generates performance reports (/generate_report) with Chart.js.
Exports PDF reports (/export_pdf) with FPDF and Matplotlib.

# Database
The academic performance analytic system database is designed to manage student performance, interventions, and user roles (teachers, parents, and administrators). Below is a breakdown of its structure and purpose:

1. Users Table (users)
This table stores login credentials and roles of users (teachers, parents, admins).

user_id â€“ Unique identifier for each user.
username â€“ Unique name used for login.
password â€“ Stores hashed passwords for security.
role â€“ Defines the userâ€™s role (teacher, parent, admin).
ðŸ’¡ Purpose: Enables role-based access control (RBAC).

2. Students Table (students)
This table stores student details and their relationship with teachers and parents.

student_id â€“ Unique identifier for each student.
name â€“ Student's full name.
class â€“ Class or grade level.
teacher_id â€“ Links to the teacher responsible for the student (from users).
parent_id â€“ Links to the parent of the student (from users).
ðŸ’¡ Purpose:

Helps associate students with specific teachers and parents.
Useful for tracking student progress and interventions.
3. Subjects Table (subjects)
This table stores different subjects offered in the academic system.

subject_id â€“ Unique identifier for each subject.
subject_name â€“ Name of the subject (e.g., Mathematics, Science).
ðŸ’¡ Purpose:

Allows flexibility in tracking test scores for multiple subjects.
4. Performance Table (performance)
Tracks students' academic and non-academic performance.

performance_id â€“ Unique identifier.
student_id â€“ Links to the student (from students).
subject_id â€“ Links to the subject (from subjects).
attendance â€“ Percentage of classes attended (0-100).
test_score â€“ Score in the subject (0-100).
extracurricular_participation â€“ Participation score in extracurricular activities (0-100).
behavior_score â€“ Behavior rating (0-100).
ðŸ’¡ Purpose:

Stores student academic performance in multiple subjects.
Tracks non-academic factors like behavior and extracurricular participation.
5. Alerts Table (alerts)
Stores alerts triggered by low performance, attendance, or behavior issues.

alert_id â€“ Unique identifier.
student_id â€“ Links to the affected student (from students).
message â€“ Description of the issue.
status â€“ Indicates if the alert is pending or resolved.
created_at â€“ Timestamp of when the alert was generated.
ðŸ’¡ Purpose:

Notifies parents and teachers of student issues.
Helps in taking timely actions for improvement.
6. Interventions Table (interventions)
Stores actions taken to help students improve performance.

intervention_id â€“ Unique identifier.
student_id â€“ Links to the student (from students).
intervention â€“ Description of the action taken.
outcome â€“ Results of the intervention (optional).
date â€“ Timestamp of when the intervention was applied.
ðŸ’¡ Purpose:

Helps track and evaluate strategies used to improve student performance.
7. Feedback Table (feedback)
Stores feedback on the effectiveness of interventions.

feedback_id â€“ Unique identifier.
intervention_id â€“ Links to the intervention (from interventions).
feedback â€“ Comments or evaluation of the intervention.
given_at â€“ Timestamp of when feedback was provided.
ðŸ’¡ Purpose:

Collects insights to refine future interventions.
ðŸ“Œ Summary of Relationships
Users (teachers & parents) â†’ Students (A teacher/parent is linked to students).
Students â†’ Performance (Each student has performance records).
Students â†’ Alerts (Alerts are generated for specific students).
Students â†’ Interventions (Interventions are applied to students).
Interventions â†’ Feedback (Feedback is collected on interventions).
ðŸš€ Benefits of This Database
âœ… Scalability â€“ Can handle multiple subjects and students.
âœ… Data Integrity â€“ Uses FOREIGN KEY constraints to maintain relationships.
âœ… Flexibility â€“ Supports both academic and behavioral tracking.
âœ… Automation Potential â€“ Can integrate machine learning (e.g., Decision Trees) for predicting student risks.
